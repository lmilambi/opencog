 * Score calculated from the behavioral score, using boosting.
 *
 * The score is calculated as a weighted sum of the bscore over all samples:
 *      score = sum_x weight(x) * BScore(x)
 *
 * Each element in the bscore typically corresponds to a sample in a
 * supervised training set, that is, a row of a table contianing the
 * training data. The weight is an adjustment, computed by applying a
 * standard AdaBoost-style algorithm.  See, for example
 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdaBoost
